# Agent Instructions

## Project Context

**entropy-wiki** is a cyber-utilitarian monorepo for AI skills, prompts, and MCP toolsets. We capture the chaos of real systems, compress it, and ship it as repeatable advantage.

**Architecture:**
- `docs/beads/`: Atomic logic snippets
- `docs/skills-bank/`: Functional capabilities
- `docs/prompt-bank/`: Categorized, high-performance prompts
- `docs/tooling-mcp/`: MCP server configs, custom tool definitions, API bridge logic
- `docs/orchestration/`: Multi-agent handoff protocols and state-management
- `docs/context/`: MAP.md strategies, context pruning, token saving
- `docs/lab/`: Learnings, failure logs, model-specific quirks

**Standards:**
- Keep entries short, dense, and operational
- If a file can't be executed, it should at least be copy-pastable
- Avoid fluff—every line should increase capability or reduce ambiguity

### [KNOWLEDGE_VAULT]
- **Location:** `/docs/reference/`
- **Contents:** Official Readmes and specs for Beads, bv (Beads Viewer), and Gastown.
- **Rule:** Before executing any `bd` command or proposing a Gastown workflow, you MUST consult the markdown files in `/docs/reference`. 
- **Constraint:** Do not hallucinate CLI flags. If the reference docs do not mention a flag, assume it does not exist.

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **SYNC BEADS** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   bd sync  # Commits and syncs all beads changes to git
   ```
5. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
6. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
7. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed (both code AND beads)
8. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)
bv

# CLI commands for agents (use these instead)
bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
bd list --status=open # All open issues
bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
bd create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
bd update <id> --status=in_progress
bd close <id> --reason="Completed"
bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
bd sync               # Commit and push changes
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
bd sync                 # Commit beads changes
git commit -m "..."     # Commit code
bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes
git push                # Push to remote
```

### Best Practices

- Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always `bd sync` before ending session
